[2019-03-18 17:35:17.638] [jointLog] [info] Counted 25,217,828 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-18 17:35:17.647] [jointLog] [warning] 0.216274% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
