[2019-03-18 17:11:07.129] [jointLog] [info] Counted 31,484,610 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-18 17:11:07.135] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0027415% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
