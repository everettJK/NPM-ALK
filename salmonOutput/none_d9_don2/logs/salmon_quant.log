[2019-03-18 17:26:41.900] [jointLog] [info] Counted 22,129,172 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-18 17:26:41.908] [jointLog] [warning] 0.234418% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
