[2019-03-18 17:46:32.590] [jointLog] [info] Counted 30,544,546 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-18 17:46:32.598] [jointLog] [warning] 0.291456% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
