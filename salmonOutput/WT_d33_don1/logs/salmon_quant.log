[2019-03-18 17:48:41.260] [jointLog] [info] Counted 24,464,151 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-18 17:48:41.268] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00130783% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 29.
