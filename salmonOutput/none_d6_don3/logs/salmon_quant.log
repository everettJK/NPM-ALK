[2019-03-18 17:39:36.583] [jointLog] [info] Counted 24,046,661 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-18 17:39:36.592] [jointLog] [warning] 0.259839% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
