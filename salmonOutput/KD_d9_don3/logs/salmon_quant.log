[2019-03-18 17:44:01.807] [jointLog] [info] Counted 32,447,887 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-18 17:44:01.815] [jointLog] [warning] 0.254931% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 24.
