[2019-03-18 18:01:07.540] [jointLog] [info] Counted 25,493,681 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-18 18:01:07.547] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0016764% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
