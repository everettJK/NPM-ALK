[2019-03-18 17:22:08.156] [jointLog] [info] Counted 33,914,944 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-03-18 17:22:08.165] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00219724% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 28.
